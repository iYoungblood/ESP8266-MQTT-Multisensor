# ESP8266-MQTT-Multisensor
ESP8266 Home Automation device with Temp, Humidity, Motion and Light using AWS IoT Core

This is a version of BRUH_Automations Multisensor device that I optimized for my use case (AWS).

Differences - 1. Uses AWS in place of Mosquitto 2. Removed the LED. No need for another light and power draw.

# To use:
1. Refer to this to get started - Not going to recreate the wheel.

1.1 Once you have the board setup, use my code and files in this repo.

2. Follow the directions in the .ino file for modules needed.

3. Fill out the arduino_secrets.c with your parameters

4. Profit
